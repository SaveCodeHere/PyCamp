    "# Print vs Logging in Python - Best Practices Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Question: Is `print()` Always Bad Practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short Answer:** No! `print()` isn't always bad practice, but it depends on the context and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When `print()` is Perfectly Fine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning and Development\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Debugging during development\n",
    "user_input = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "print(f\"DEBUG: User entered '{user_input}'\")  # Fine for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quick scripts and prototypes\n",
    "total = sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "print(f\"Total: {total}\")  # Perfectly fine for simple scripts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Line Tools\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# CLI applications where output is expected\n",
    "def calculate_tax(amount, rate):\n",
    "    tax = amount * rate\n",
    "    print(f\"Tax on ${amount}: ${tax:.2f}\")  # This is the intended output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Programs\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# User-facing applications\n",
    "print(\"Welcome to the Calculator!\")\n",
    "print(\"1. Add\")\n",
    "print(\"2. Subtract\")\n",
    "choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## When `print()` Becomes Poor Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Applications\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ‚ùå Bad in production code\n",
    "def process_payment(amount):\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing payment of ${amount}\")  # This will clutter logs\n",
    "    # ... payment logic\n",
    "    print(\"Payment completed\")  # Hard to control or filter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ‚ùå Bad - libraries shouldn't print directly\n",
    "def validate_email(email):\n",
    "    if \"@\" not in email:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid email!\")  # Forces output on library users\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Better Alternatives for Production Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Logging Instead\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "def process_payment(amount):\n",
    "    logger.info(f\"Processing payment of ${amount}\")\n",
    "    # ... payment logic\n",
    "    logger.info(\"Payment completed successfully\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "def validate_email(email):\n",
    "    if \"@\" not in email:\n",
    "        logger.warning(f\"Invalid email format: {email}\")\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values Instead of Printing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ‚úÖ Better - let the caller decide what to do with the result\n",
    "def calculate_tax(amount, rate):\n",
    "    return amount * rate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Caller can print, log, or use the value\n",
    "tax = calculate_tax(1000, 0.08)\n",
    "print(f\"Tax: ${tax:.2f}\")  # Now print() is appropriate here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging Levels and When to Use Them\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "def process_order(order_id):\n",
    "    logger.debug(f\"Starting to process order {order_id}\")      # Development info\n",
    "    logger.info(f\"Processing order {order_id}\")               # General info\n",
    "    logger.warning(f\"Order {order_id} has no shipping info\")  # Potential issues\n",
    "    logger.error(f\"Failed to process order {order_id}\")       # Errors\n",
    "    logger.critical(f\"Database connection lost\")              # Critical failures\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging Level Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | When to Use | Example |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| `DEBUG` | Detailed information for diagnosing problems | Variable values, function entry/exit |\n",
    "| `INFO` | General information about program execution | \"Server started\", \"User logged in\" |\n",
    "| `WARNING` | Something unexpected happened, but program continues | \"Disk space low\", \"Deprecated function used\" |\n",
    "| `ERROR` | A serious problem occurred, function failed | \"Database connection failed\", \"File not found\" |\n",
    "| `CRITICAL` | A very serious error, program may stop | \"Out of memory\", \"Configuration file missing\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences: Print vs Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | `print()` | `logging` |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Control** | Always outputs | Can be turned on/off by level |\n",
    "| **Destination** | Always to stdout | Can go to files, network, etc. |\n",
    "| **Formatting** | Manual | Automatic timestamps, levels, etc. |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Always executes | Can be disabled for better performance |\n",
    "| **Filtering** | No filtering | Can filter by level, module, etc. |\n",

    "### ‚úÖ Use `print()` for:\n",
    "- Learning and experimenting with Python\n",
    "- Debugging during development\n",
    "- Command-line tools and scripts\n",
    "- Interactive programs where user output is expected\n",
    "- Simple scripts that need to display results\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Use `logging` for:\n",
    "- Production applications\n",
    "- Libraries and reusable modules\n",
    "- Long-running services and applications\n",
    "- When you need different levels of verbosity\n",
    "- When output needs to be controlled or redirected\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ The Golden Rule\n",
    "**`print()` is for output, `logging` is for diagnostics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your message is part of your program's intended functionality (like showing results to a user), use `print()`. If it's for debugging, monitoring, or understanding what your program is doing internally, use `logging`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Setup for Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic configuration\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(\n",
    "    level=logging.INFO,\n",
    "    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now you can use it\n",
    "logger.info(\"This is an info message\")\n",
    "logger.error(\"This is an error message\")\n",
    "```\n",
