    "- **Debugging:** You can use `print()` to check the values of variables or see what part of your code is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "You type `print()` and put whatever you want to display inside the parentheses.\n",
    "If you want to display text (called a \"string\"), you need to enclose it in quotes (either single `' '` or double `\" \"`).\n",

    "Variables in Python are used to store data values. You can assign different types of data to variables and use them throughout your program.\n",

    "## Variable Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Rules (Required)\n",
    "- **Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_)**\n",
    "- **Can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores**\n",
    "- **Are case-sensitive** (`age` is different from `Age`)\n",
    "- **Cannot use Python keywords** (like `if`, `for`, `class`, `def`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Style Guidelines (Recommended)\n",
    "- **Choose descriptive names** (e.g., `student_name` instead of `s` or `sn`)\n",
    "- **Use `snake_case`** (all lowercase with underscores separating words)\n",
    "- **Avoid single letters** except for counters (like `i`, `j` in loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Valid vs Invalid Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Valid variable names\n",
    "user_name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age2 = 30\n",
    "_private_var = \"hidden\"\n",
    "MAX_SIZE = 100\n",

    "_internal_counter = 0\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._balance = 1000  # \"Private\" attribute\n",
    "```\n",

    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__secret_key = \"abc123\"  # Harder to access from outside\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Underscore (`_`)\n",
    "Used as a throwaway variable when you don't need the value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for _ in range(5):  # Don't care about the loop counter\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "_, middle, _ = (1, 2, 3)  # Only want the middle value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magic Methods (`__method__`)\n",
    "Special methods with double underscores on both sides:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):  # Constructor\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "        return f\"Person named {self.name}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trailing Underscore (`variable_`)\n",
    "Used to avoid conflicts with Python keywords:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class_ = \"Mathematics\"  # Avoid conflict with 'class' keyword\n",
    "type_ = \"integer\"       # Avoid conflict with 'type' function\n",

    "- **Floats (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., -3.14, 0.0, 99.99).\n",

    "*   **`print()`:** Your primary tool for displaying information. (Note: Read the print vs logging file)\n",
    "*   **Comments (`#`):** Essential for explaining your code.\n",
    "*   **Variables:** Named containers for storing data (`name = \"value\"`).\n",
    "*   **Data Types:** Python has various types like `str` (text), `int` (whole numbers), `float` (decimal numbers), `bool` (True/False).\n",
    "*   **Type Conversion:** Change data from one type to another (e.g., `int()`, `str()`, `float()`).\n",
    "*   **Strings:**\n",
    "    *   Concatenate with `+`.\n",
    "    *   f-strings (e.g., `f\"Hello {variable}\"`) are a powerful way to format strings.\n",

    "3.  **Area of a Rectangle Function:**\n",
    "    *   Define a function called `calculate_rectangle_area` that takes two parameters: `length` and `width`.\n",
    "    *   Inside the function, calculate the area (`length * width`).\n",
    "    *   The function should `return` the calculated area.\n",
    "    *   Ask the user for the length and width of a rectangle.\n",
    "    *   Call your function with the user's input and print the returned area.\n",

    "4.  **Temperature Converter Function:**\n",
    "    *   Define a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit` that takes one parameter: `temp_celsius`.\n",
    "    *   The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`.\n",
    "    *   The function should calculate and `return` the temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
    "    *   Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius.\n",
    "    *   Call your function and print the result, e.g., \"[Celsius temp]°C is [Fahrenheit temp]°F.\"\n",
