    "\n",
    "In a file called `faces.py` (or in the cell below for this notebook), implement a function called `convert` that accepts a string as input and returns that same string with any `:)` converted to 🙂 and any `:(` converted to 🙁. All other text should be returned unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in a `main` function, prompt the user for input, call `convert` on that input, and print the result. You're welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "The program should expect a string from the user that might contain `:)` and/or `:(`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "The program should output the same string but with emoticons converted to emojis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Input: `Hello :)`\n",
    "  Output: `Hello 🙂`\n",
    "- Input: `Hello :( Goodbye :)`\n",
    "  Output: `Hello 🙁 Goodbye 🙂`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Hints (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the string `replace()` method to substitute one string for another\n",
    "- Remember that functions should have a clear single responsibility\n",
    "- Test your function with various combinations of emoticons\n",
