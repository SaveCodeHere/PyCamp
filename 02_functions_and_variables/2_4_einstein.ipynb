    "Even if you haven't studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that E = mc², wherein E represents energy (measured in Joules), m represents mass (measured in kilograms), and c represents the speed of light (measured in meters per second), which is approximately 300000000. Write a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent energy in Joules, as calculated using Einstein's famous formula.\n",
