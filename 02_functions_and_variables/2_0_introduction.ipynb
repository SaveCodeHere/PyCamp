    "#\n",
    "# **What it is:**\n",
    "# The `print()` function is one of the most basic and frequently used functions in Python.\n",
    "# It's used to display output to the console or screen. You can \"print\" text, numbers,\n",
    "# or the values stored in variables.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Why it matters:**\n",
    "# - **Feedback:** It's how your program communicates with you or the user.\n",
    "# - **Debugging:** You can use `print()` to check the values of variables or see what part of your code is being executed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **How it works:**\n",
    "# You type `print()` and put whatever you want to display inside the parentheses.\n",
    "# If you want to display text (called a \"string\"), you need to enclose it in quotes (either single `' '` or double `\" \"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1: Printing a simple message\n",
    "print(\"Hello, PyCamp!\")\n",
    "\n",

    "#\n",
    "# **What it is:**\n",
    "# Data types classify the kind of values a variable can hold. Python automatically figures out the data type.\n",
    "# Some fundamental types include:\n",
    "# - **Strings (`str`):** Sequences of characters (text). Enclosed in quotes.\n",
    "# - **Integers (`int`):** Whole numbers (e.g., -5, 0, 100).\n",
    "# - **Floats (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., -3.14, 0.0, 99.99).\n",
    "# - **Booleans (`bool`):** Represent truth values, either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Why it matters:**\n",
    "# The data type determines what operations you can perform on the data. For example, you can\n",
    "# do arithmetic with integers and floats, but not directly with strings in the same way.\n",
    "#\n",
