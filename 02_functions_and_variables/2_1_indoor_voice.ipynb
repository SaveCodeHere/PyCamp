    "- `input()`: Getting text input from the user.\n",
    "- Variables: Storing data (like user input) using names.\n",
    "- String Methods: `.lower()` for converting a string to lowercase.\n",
    "- Defining Simple Functions: `def function_name():` (though not strictly required for this specific problem, it's good practice to start thinking about).\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In a file called `indoor.py` (or in the cell below for this notebook), implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly by passing a string to `input`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "The program should expect a single line of text from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "The program should output the user's input, converted entirely to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that the `input()` function returns a string.\n",
    "- Look up Python string methods. There's one that's perfect for this!\n",
