    "\n",
    "In Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" a supercomputer named Deep Thought spent 7.5 million years computing the answer to the \"great question of life, the universe, and everything.\" The answer turned out to be 42. Write a program that prompts the user for the answer to the great question of life, the universe, and everything, and outputs \"Yes\" if the user inputs 42, \"forty-two\", or \"forty two\". Otherwise output \"No\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "The program should prompt the user for the answer to life, the universe and everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "The program should output either \"Yes\" or \"No\" depending on whether the input matches any form of \"42\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Hints (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider using `.lower()` to handle capitalization\n",
    "- Remember `.strip()` to handle extra whitespace\n",
    "- The answer can be written in multiple ways (42, forty-two, forty two)\n",
    "- Use conditional statements to check for different forms of the answer\n",
