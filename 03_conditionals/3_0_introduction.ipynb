    "    *   Create two variables, `stored_username` and `stored_password`, and assign them some values (e.g., \"user123\", \"pass456\").\n",

    "        *   \"Scalene\" (all three sides are different)\n",

    "    *   If age is less than 5, ticket is free.\n",
    "    *   If age is between 5 (inclusive) and 12 (inclusive), ticket is $5.\n",
