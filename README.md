# PyCamp

This repository is Jupyter Notebook-ready and is based on the CS50 Harvard course: Introduction to Python.

- The repo is structured to help you learn Python fundamentals, focusing on functions, variables, and conditionals.
- For these core topics, you'll find both introductory explanations and problems to solve, as well as some extra, fully explained examples.
- After mastering the basics, subsequent sections provide problems to solve in the introductory notebooks, allowing you to practice and apply your knowledge independently.

Get started by opening the notebooks and following along with the exercises!
