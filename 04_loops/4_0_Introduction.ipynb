    "# Week 2: Loops - Doing Things Repeatedly\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 2 of PyCamp! Last week, we learned about how to make decisions in our code\n",
    "using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`). This week, we're diving into **loops**,\n",

    "# ## 1. What are Loops?\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **What it is:**\n",
    "# Loops are control flow structures that allow you to execute a statement or a group of statements\n",
    "# multiple times. Imagine you need to print \"Hello\" five times. Instead of writing `print(\"Hello\")`\n",
    "# five times, you can use a loop.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Why it matters:**\n",
    "# - **Automation:** Loops are fundamental for automating repetitive tasks.\n",
    "# - **Efficiency:** They make your code more concise and easier to manage than repeating code blocks.\n",
    "# - **Data Processing:** Essential for iterating over collections of data like lists, strings, or records from a file.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Python has two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",

    "# A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string) or other iterable objects.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Why it matters:**\n",

    "## 8. Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Countdown:** Write a `while` loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints \"Liftoff!\".\n",
    "2.  **Sum of List:** Given a list of numbers `my_numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 10]`, use a `for` loop to calculate and print their sum.\n",
    "3.  **Even Numbers Printer:** Use a `for` loop with `range()` to print all even numbers between 1 and 20 (inclusive).\n",
    "4.  **Find First 's':** Given the string `sentence = \"This is a sample sentence.\"`, use a `for` loop and `break` to find and print the index of the first occurrence of the letter 's'. If 's' is not found, print \"Letter 's' not found.\" (Hint: you might need a variable to keep track of the index and another to know if 's' was found).\n",
    "5.  **Vowel Counter:** Write a program that asks the user for a word and then uses a `for` loop to count and print the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the word. (Make it case-insensitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to solve these on your own! If you get stuck, think about which type of loop and which control statements might be useful."
